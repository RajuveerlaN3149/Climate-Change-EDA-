# Climate-Change-EDA-
It addresses CO2 in the atmosphere and temperature changes all over the world.

The Daily CardinalClimate change has been a serious topic this year, I am sure that if you live on planet earth you have heard that our planet is warming rapidly.

# What water issue will I be addressing on this EDA? 

"The carbon dioxide record from Mauna Loa Observatory, known as the "Keeling Curve," is the world's longest unbroken record of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Scientists make atmospheric measurements in remote locations to sample air that is representative of a large volume of Earth's atmosphere and relatively free from local influences. This dataset includes a monthly observation of atmospheric carbon dioxide (or CO2) concentrations from the Mauna Loa Observatory (Hawaii) at a latitude of 19.5, the longitude of -155.6, and elevation of 3397 meters. 
Columns 1â€“3: Provide the date in the following redundant formats: year, month and decimal date
Column 4: Monthly CO2 concentrations in parts per million (ppm) measured on the 08A calibration scale and collected at 24:00 hours on the fifteenth of each month. 
Column 5: The fifth column provides the same data after a seasonal adjustment, which involves subtracting from the data a 4-harmonic fit with a linear gain factor to remove the seasonal cycle from carbon dioxide measurements 
Column 6: The sixth column provides the data with noise removed, generated from a stiff cubic spline function plus 4-harmonic functions with linear gain. 
Column 7: The seventh column is the same data with the seasonal cycle removed."

"The Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Study combines 1.6 billion temperature reports from 16 pre-existing archives. It is nicely packaged and allows for slicing into interesting subsets (for example by country). They publish the source data and the code for the transformations they applied. They also use methods that allow weather observations from a shorter time series to be included, meaning fewer observations need to be thrown away. 
In this dataset, they have included several files: Global Land and Ocean-and-Land Temperatures: Date: starts in 1750 for average land temperature and 1850 for max and min land temperatures and global ocean and land temperatures LandAverageTemperature: global average land temperature in celsius LandAverageTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the average LandMaxTemperature: global average maximum land temperature in celsius 

- LandMaxTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the maximum land temperature 
- LandMinTemperature: global average minimum land temperature in celsius 
- LandMinTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the minimum land temperature.
- LandAndOceanAverageTemperature: global average land and ocean temperature in celsius.
- LandAndOceanAverageTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the global average land and ocean temperature Other files include: 
- Global Average Land Temperature by Country
- Global Average Land Temperature by State
- Global Land Temperatures By Major City
- Global Land Temperatures By City"

# What generally causes this kind of issue? 
Earth's temperature depends on the balance between energy entering and leaving the planet's system. When incoming energy from the sun is absorbed by the Earth system, Earth warms. When the sun's energy is reflected back into space, Earth avoids warming. When absorbed energy is released back into space, Earth cools. Many factors, both natural and human, can cause changes in Earth's energy balance, including: Variations in the sun's energy reaching Earth Changes in the reflectivity of Earth's atmosphere and surface Changes in the greenhouse effect, which affects the amount of heat retained by Earth's atmosphere.
